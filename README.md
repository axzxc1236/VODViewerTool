**Disclaimer**
There is no any grantee the default Client ID will work forever (In fact by publishing this repository I think It will definitely be disabled at some point), when the Client ID is revoked you should get your own Client ID from [Twitch Developers Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/) and set it in the webpage.

And the API this program depends on will one day be deprecieated and disabled, no gurantee that I will fix it.

This tool might be broken, and is not totally fool proof
